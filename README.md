AI Engineer and Senior Data Scientist with 9+ years of experience designing end-to-end AI solutions that solve real business problems. I’ve built agentic AI systems that use local LLMs to plan and execute daily workflows autonomously, handling tasks such as client follow-ups, CRM updates, and calendar scheduling without human intervention. My work spans offline GenAI tools, intelligent automation, chatbot development, and full-stack ML deployments using Streamlit, FastAPI, MySQL, and AWS. I combine deep technical skills in LLMs, RAG, and MLOps with a product mindset, leading projects from concept to delivery across industries. I thrive in fast-moving teams and am passionate about building AI products that are useful, responsible, and impactful. I’m now looking to join an innovative team where I can apply my AI skills to build products that make a real difference.
