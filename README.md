SUMMARY
Senior AI Engineer and Data Scientist with over 9 years of experience delivering cutting-edge AI systems that integrate computer vision, large language models (LLMs), and intelligent automation. I specialize in building and deploying end-to-end platforms using open-weight models like Mistral-7B, OpenHermes-2.5, and MythoMax-13B, with hands-on experience in LLM fine-tuning using QLoRA, PEFT, and GGUF formats for resource-efficient, domain-specific optimization. I’ve engineered multi-agent pipelines using LangChain, LlamaIndex, and LM Studio to enable reasoning, planning, and decision-making across safety compliance, fraud detection, and insurance workflows. My work includes training custom YOLOv8 classifiers, building CLIP + FAISS visual retrieval engines, and implementing Siamese networks for tampering detection. I bring deep technical fluency in Python, PyTorch, FastAPI, Docker, Kubernetes, Streamlit, and real-time inferencing, with robust MLOps experience on AWS, Azure, and GCP. With a strong product mindset and a track record of deploying scalable, explainable, and secure AI solutions, I’m passionate about driving innovation where GenAI meets high-stakes, real-world problems.
